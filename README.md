# Handmade Craft Server

Welcome to the Handmade Craft Server! This server provides endpoints to manage handmade craft products. It includes features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests. Here are the available endpoints:

  Create a new product. Requires authentication.

### Authentication

This server uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access endpoints that require authentication, include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests.

## Validation

Validation middleware is implemented to ensure that requests meet certain criteria before being processed. This helps maintain data integrity and security.

## Folder Structure
